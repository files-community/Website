Files is a modern file manager app for Windows that offers a sleek and intuitive user interface with powerful features. In this post, we’ll take a look at some of the new features and improvements that we’ve added in version v2.4.40.

### Tagging System 🏷️
One of the most requested features from our users was the ability to add tags to files and folders. Tags are labels that help you categorize and find your files faster. You can use tags to group files by project, priority, status or any other criteria that suits your needs.

In Files v2.4.40, we’ve added a settings page for editing tags where you can create, rename or delete tags as well as change their colors. You can access this page from the settings menu.

To add tags to files or folders, simply right click them and use the "edit tags" menu to add or remove tags

You can also remove tags from files or folders by clicking on the remove tag icon in the details layout.

To view all files with a specific tag, you can use the search box in Files and type `tag:` followed by the tag name. For example, `tag:important` will show all files tagged as important.

We hope you’ll find this feature useful and we’d love to hear your feedback on how we can improve it further.

### UI Improvements 🎨
We’ve also made some UI improvements to make it more consistent and polished.

One of these improvements is that we’ve refreshed the icons in the toolbar and right click context menu to better match the Fluent Design System guidelines.

Another improvement is that we’ve moved the context menu settings to the preferences page where you can customize which items appear in the right click context menu.

You can also hide some items from the context menu such as “Open in new tab” or “Open in new window” if you don’t use them often.

### Other Fixes and Enhancements 🛠️
Besides these major features and UI improvements, we’ve also fixed some bugs and added some enhancements such as:

- Added shell extensions when right clicking widgets on the home page
- Added keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+`) to open Windows Terminal as administrator
- Fixed issue where items would sometimes be selected when they shouldn’t have been
- Fixed issue where shell extensions wouldn’t show when right clicking in archives
- Fixed issue where tab icons weren’t showing
- Fixed an issue with resizing columns in the details layout
You can find more details about these fixes and enhancements on our GitHub repository: https://github.com/files-community/Files/releases/tag/v2.4.40

### Conclusion 🙌
That’s all for this update! We hope you enjoy using Files v2.4.40 as much as we enjoyed making it.
