We're excited to announce that version 2.5.10 is now available. If you already have Files, you'll get a notification in the app to update. Otherwise, you can download Files for free from our [download page](/download/).

**TL;DR:** This update adds Git columns to the details layout, an open VS Code button in Git repos, and improvements to the details pane. Continue reading to learn more about these changes.

## What's new in v2.5.10

### Git columns in the details layout

Opening a Git repo in the details layout will now display additional columns with information about the Git status, last commit, commit hash, and commit author. These columns can be toggled by right clicking the column headers.

### Open Git repo in VS Code

When viewing a Git repo, the status bar will now show a button to open the folder in VS Code. Support for additional applications is being considered.

### Show details about the current directory when no items are selected

The details pane will show information about the current directory when no items are currently selected. In the future, we have plans to show storage details when viewing drives.

## Changes and Improvements

### [Removed the Bundles widget]

Earlier this year, we announced plans to replace the Bundles widget with the Tags widget. Starting in v2.5.10, the Bundles widget is no longer available.

### [Auto-Populate version information when submitting feedback]

Submitting feedback from the About page will automatically fill out the version information on the GitHub issue.

### [Separated the archive options in the right-click menu]

The menu items for compressing and extracting files has been separated into two separate menus. Previously the items were grouped together under "Archive".

### [Added an option to hide the Send To menu]

Users looking to customize the right-click menu can now hide the Send To menu.
