We're excited to announce that version 2.5.20 is now available. If you already have Files, you'll get a notification in the app to update. Otherwise, you can download Files for free from our [download page](/download/). You can also purchase Files on the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9nghp3dx8hdx&cid=FilesWebsite) as a way to support the project.

**TL;DR:** This update adds support for pushing Git commits, an improved startup experience, updated toolbar and status icons, support for editing tags from the Details pane, and more. Continue reading to learn more about these changes.

## What's new in v2.5.20

### Push Git commits to remote repositories

To further improve our integration with Git, we're excited to be adding support for pushing commits to remote repos. The Status Bar will display you how many local and remote commits you have, and you can click on it to access the sync, pull, and push options. We hope this feature makes it easier for you to collaborate with other developers and keep your code up to date.

### Improvements to the startup experience

Startup performance is one of our highest priorities and something we're working on improving. We'd like the progress to be faster but unfortunately there are some limitations in the WinAppSdk framework. We hope these limitations will be resolved in future versions of WinAppSdk, but in the meantime, we've been working on a lot of smaller optimizations that we hope will add up over time. We're also adding a splash screen when the app is opened to indicate that the app is loading.

### Redesigned layout icons

We redesigned the icons in the layout flyout to be more consistent with the design language in Files. Additionally, the icon on the toolbar now changes to match the selected layout.

### Added support for ownCloud

Files will now detect and display ownCloud in the sidebar when the ownCloud client is installed.

### Change the behavior of actions using modifier keys

Holding down modifier keys when pressing on certain toolbar buttons will now change to behavior. For example, holding down `shift` while pressing the `delete` button on the toolbar will permanently delete the selected items.

### Added a path column when viewing search results in the Details layout

We added a path column to the Details layout when viewing the results of a search. This feature also enables you to also sort and group the search results by path.

### Added "Size on disk" property to the Properties window

We added a "Size on disk" property when viewing the properties of cloud folders.

### Added support for opening all tagged items from the Tags widget

We added a button to the Tags widget for opening all the items with that tag.

## Changes and Improvements

### Status Bar design

We added lines to divide the different sections in the Status Bar.

### Readme files are no longer automatically selected

Opening a folder with a `readme.md` file will no longer select the readme file.

### Improved quality of the icons in the pinned favorites section

We made several enhancements to improve the quality of icons in the pinned favorites section.

### Updated the Tag icon used throughout the app

The tag icon in the sidebar, right click context menu, and Tags widget was updated to have better contrast.

### Updated the Toolbar icons

We updated a number of toolbars icons, we also updated the icons for the cloud status, and Git status columns in the Details layout.

### Updated the DataGrid in the Details layout

We redesigned the DataGrid headers in the Details layout to better match the design language in Windows 11.

### Increased the maximum volume label length to 128 characters for UDF images

Based on user feedback, we increased the maximum volume label length to 128 characters for UDF images.
