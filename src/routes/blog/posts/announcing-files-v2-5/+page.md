Today we're excited to announce the next major release of Files, version 2.5. If you already have Files, you'll get a notification in the app to update. Otherwise, you can download Files for free from our [download page](/download/).

**TL;DR:** This update adds back the option for Acrylic, a new Git integration, and improvements to the preview pane. Continue reading to learn more about these changes.

## What's new in v2.5

### Acrylic backdrop material

We heard the feedback loud and clear: users want the option to set the backdrop material to Acrylic. This feature was removed when we migrated from UWP to WinAppSdk but over the last few months these issues have been resolved and we're happy to announce that Acrylic is available again.

### Swiping gestures for navigation

Swiping gestures allows users to navigate in Files with ease. Swipe from the left to go back, and swipe from the right to go forward. These gestures are compatible with both touch screens and touch pads.

### Manage repositories natively with Git

We added a couple of Git features to Files that make it easier to work with Git repositories.

- The branch name is now displayed on the status bar
- Checkout remote branches, and switch between local branches from the branches flyout
- Pull commits from remote repositories using the 'Pull' button on the status bar
- Create new branches
- Track changes with the Git columns in the details layout (coming soon)
- We plan to add more Git features in future updates, so stay tuned!

### SeerPro

SeerPro is a popular app for previewing files and documents with a single press of the space bar. We're excited to partner with SeerPro so users with SeerPro can now use this feature from Files. Learn more here http://1218.io/.

## Changes and Improvements

### [Preview and Details pane]

- The preview and detail panes are now separated into two. Users can switch between the two panes using the new pivot control. Additionally, the preview will now stretch to fill the available space in the pane.
- Improved the layout when the preview pane is in the horizontal orientation.

### [Display and edit metadata of multiple files]

Display and edit metadata of multiple files in the properties window. Previously it was only possible to edit metadata for a single file at a time.
