Today, we're pleased to announce
that [Files v2.1]({'https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nghp3dx8hdx?cid=AnnouncingV2-1'})
is now available. We focused on improving the performance and behavior of existing features in this update to make it
even easier for you to use the app.

## Setting Files as the default file manager

We recently added an experimental option to set Files as the default file manager. This option is still experimental but
we improved the reliability based on your feedback and it's stable enough for regular use. If you're already using this
option, we recommend turning it off and back on again in order to take advantage of the latest improvements.

## What's Changed

- Redesigned the settings dialog
- Redesigned the properties window
