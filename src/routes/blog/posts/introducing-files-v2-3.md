The astounding growth of the project over the last two years serves to motivate our journey to build the best file manager, alongside the community. More than ever, Files plays an important role in demonstrating how impactful the latest user experience improvements in WinUI can be. A notable experience we can reflect on was fixing an issue with screen reader accessibility in one of our layout modes reported by a blind user. More recently, we were delighted to hear from a seventy-seven-year-old "non-geek" who was impressed that we made file discovery "much easier" compared to the first party solution. Both of these stories highlight the inadvertent achievements that come from engaging the broader community.

Today we're excited to not only introduce the next major release of Files, but also a series of future changes to sustain contributor momentum into 2023. 

## Introducing a new major release - Files v2.3

As part of our mission to create a stable and fully featured file manager, we added new features such as a compact spacing feature, new bulk actions experience in the conflicts dialog, and double click gesture to navigate up one directory. Additionally, we worked on improving the behavior of existing features with the understanding that they're most useful when they perform as expected.

**Compact sizing** allows users to view more items on the screen

The **tab control** was redesigned to better connect with the rest of the app

We added an option to display **tags** on the sidebar

## The next generation of Files

This milestone marks the beginning of a reinvigorated effort to modernize and improve architecture of the Files codebase. A well-architected, testable codebase will not only attract new contributors, but enables us to offer platform specific benefits in the long run. Further, we will be able to iterate faster, accelerating our transition to the Windows App SDK. Switching will remove longstanding limitations in the present app model and enables us to deliver improvements in net performance and reliability.

### The role of community talent and expertise
We want to thank all of our users for the last several years. We have big plans for your role in driving both feature design and development. This is why an enhanced issue triage process is currently in the discussion phase. We want interested users and contributors to feel a sense of ownership over the continued development of their favorite in-app experiences. Lastly, we want to sustain engagement with Files by embracing a novel development effort crowd-sourcing model for interested users and contributors in the medium term. 

We view these steps as critical to continuing the great work on Files. The best way for you to support current and future efforts is to donate [here](https://github.com/sponsors/yaichenbaum). 

### Giving back to the community

We're pleased to announce that we relicensed the Files repository under the MIT license. This means that other projects can now take advantage of the innovation in Files even if they happen to be closed source.

We will also be exploring additional efforts over the next year to expand the number of Windows developers by doing our part to offer helpful onboarding information annotated by core Files contributors. We expect this guide to be a valuable resource for anyone studying native Windows APIs, packaged apps, and UI design practices.

## Feedback

Files thrives off community feedback because it helps shape the features we work on and makes the app better for
everyone. We invite you to submit your feedback through our GitHub repository.
