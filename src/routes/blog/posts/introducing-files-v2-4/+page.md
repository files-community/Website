We're pleased to announce that after a couple of weeks, v2.4 is available for all our users. Files has auto update built-in but if you're a new user or looking to manually update, you can download Files from our new [download page](/download/). Improved performance when navigating between directories, new features for managing archives and design changes are just some of the highlights for this release.

## Supporting Files

In an effort to keep maintaining Files, we recently started charging for the Store version. Purchasing Files through the Store is the easiest way to help support the project, but we want to make users aware that this is optional and that Files can still be installed for free by using the [sideload](/download/) version. We remain committed to open-source and will continue to publish our code on GitHub as usual.

## Highlights

### Design

- Switched to using Mica Alt in the title bar for better contrast between the tabs

</figure>
- Added round corners to the file area on Windows 10, previously the round corners were only on Windows 11.
