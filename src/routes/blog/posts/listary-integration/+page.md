## Elevate your productivity with Listary

In our continuous effort to enhance your file management experience, weâ€™re proud to introduce a powerful new integration to Files. With the release of [Files v3.4](/blog/posts/v3-4) and [Listary v6.3](https://help.listary.com/changelog#63078-may-6-2024), weâ€™ve implemented a direct integration with Listary, a feature many of you have eagerly requested.

This integration is the result of a close collaboration with the Listary developer, who shares our vision of creating a seamless file management experience. Designed to complement the existing search capabilities in Files, this integration provides an even more streamlined and efficient workflow for our users.

### Start your journey with Files and Listary

[Listary](https://www.listary.com/) is a powerful search utility renowned for its rapid retrieval of files and folders. Now, with our integration, you can harness Listaryâ€™s advanced search prowess right within Files.

For those with Listary v6.3, the integration is seamless and automatic, requiring no additional setup. Otherwise, you can visit Listaryâ€™s [download](https://www.listary.com/download) page to get started.

Once enabled, you'll have access to the following features:

**Instant search results**: Simply double-tap the `ctrl` key to summon the search bar, granting you immediate access to your files.

**Quick switch**: Seamlessly transition to the active folder in Files when opening or saving documents via another application. Additionally, once the file dialog appears, you can also switch to Files, navigate to your desired folderâ€”such as a pinned locationâ€”and upon returning to the dialog, it will automatically update to reflect your chosen folder.
