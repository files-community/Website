I'm excited to announce that Files Preview is now available on the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9NSQD9PKV3SS&cid=FilesWebsite)!

## Files Preview

The preview version of Files offers early access to new features and improvements. By adding Files Preview to the Store, users have more choices on how to install Files as part of their workflow. While purchasing the Store versions of Files helps support development and is greatly appreciated, it is entirely optional. Users can continue to use the sideload option on our [download page](/download/) for free and still access the same great features and support. Additionally, anyone who has already purchased the stable version of Files on the Microsoft Store can download the Preview version for free through the end of 2024.

### Conclusion

As always, we appreciate your feedback and suggestions on how we improve Files. You can reach us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/files) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/files-community/Files/).

Thank you for using Files! 😊
