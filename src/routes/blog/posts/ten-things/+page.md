Files is a powerful file manager with many features hidden just below the surface. Here are some features you may not be aware of.

### Command Palette

Available from the Omnibar, the Command Palette is a powerful tool for discovering and running commands. See [here](/docs/features/omnibar/#command-palette) for details.

### Dual Pane

Dual Pane mode lets you view two folders side-by-side for quick comparisons and file transfers. See [here](/docs/features/dual-pane) for details.

### Quick Preview

Seamless integrations with QuickLook, SeerPro, and PowerToys Peek allow you to open a preview window for many file formats. See [here](/docs/features/integrations) for details.

### Tags

Tags are a great way to organize and quickly access important files and folders. See [here](/docs/features/tags) for details.

### Folder Backgrounds

Support for setting custom background images per folder is another way to personalize your experience. It also allows you to add visual cues or watermarks for different projects or work-related folders. See [here](/docs/features/folder-config) for details.

### Git Integration

Built-in Git support allows you to view repository status, branch information, and run common commands inside Files. You can also clone repositories by dragging a repo URL or using the Clone action. See [here](/docs/features/git) for details.

### Columns Layout

The **Columns Layout** allows you to view your files in a column layout, making it easier to navigate and find specific files. See [here](/docs/features/layout-picker) for details.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Files offers a wide array of keyboard shortcuts designed to help you quickly navigate and manage your files. The **Actions** page in settings lets you remap shortcuts or assign new ones for frequent actions. Open `Settings > Actions` to edit bindings or add shortcuts. See [here](/docs/customize-settings/actions) for details.

### Paste Screenshots

When pasting an image or screenshot from the clipboard, Files will automatically create a new image file in the directory you are currently in.

### Folder Sizes

Files has a setting to automatically display folder sizes in the file list. This is normally only done files. See [here](/docs/customize-settings/files-and-folders/#calculate-folder-sizes) for details.

### Default File Manager

Make **Files** the default file manager to replace File Explorer. This option is in `Settings > Advanced`. See [here](/docs/customize-settings/advanced/#set-files-as-the-default-file-manager) for details.

### Double Click Gesture

Double-clicking a blank space will move up one directory in the folder tree. You can turn off the double-click gesture in `Settings > Files & folders` if you prefer to use other methods of interacting with your files. See [here](/docs/customize-settings/files-and-folders/#double-click-on-a-blank-space-to-go-up-one-directory) for details.
