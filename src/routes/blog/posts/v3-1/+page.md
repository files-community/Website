We're excited to announce that starting today, Files v3.1 is now available. If you already have Files, there should be a notification on the toolbar to install the update. Otherwise, you can download Files for free from our [download page](/download/). You can also purchase Files on the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9nghp3dx8hdx&cid=FilesWebsite) or sponsor us on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/yaira2) to help support the project.

**TL;DR:** Files v3.1 adds an icon to the system tray, support for opening a minimized window on startup, smart extract, an option to prioritize files when sorting, group files by day, and more. Continue reading to learn more about these changes.

## What's new in v3.1

### System tray icon

With the recently added option to keep Files open in the background, a popular request has been to add an icon to the system tray. Besides for indicating when there is an open process, right clicking the icon provides a shortcut to the documentation site and a way to fully close the background process.

### Open minimized on Windows Startup

Enabling the option to "Open Files on Windows Startup" and the option to "Keep Files running in the background" will now open Files in the background when starting Windows.

### Extract archives with "Smart Extract"

Smart Extract is a new feature that will automatically choose the extraction mode based on the archive contents. If the archive contains a single file or folder, Smart Extract will extract the archive to the current directory, otherwise if there are multiple items, they will be extracted to a new folder. Smart Extract can be accessed via the `ctrl` + `shift` + `e` shortcut as well as the right click context menu.

### Prioritize files when sorting

We added an option to prioritize files when sorting. Enabling this option will sort files and folders separately with files being placed at the top of the list. This feature is an addition to the existing options to "sort folders first" and "sort files and folders together".

### Drag and drop to open folders in a new tab

Dragging & dropping a folder on the title bar will now open the folder in a new tab. This gesture also works with multiple folders, dragging multiple folders will open each folder in its own tab.
