We're excited to announce that starting today, Files v3.2 is now available. If you already have Files, there should be a notification on the toolbar to install the update.

You can also purchase Files on the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9nghp3dx8hdx&cid=FilesWebsite) or sponsor us on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/yaira2) to help support the project.

**TL;DR:** Files v3.2 adds a List View layout, higher quality thumbnails, support for editing album covers from the properties window, and more. Continue reading to learn more about these changes.

## What's new in v3.2

### List View layout

We added List View, a new layout option that lets you see more items in less space. It only shows the icons and file names of your items, without any extra details. To use List View, click on the layout icon on the toolbar and choose List View from the flyout menu.

### Higher quality thumbnails

We enhanced the thumbnails that represent your files and folders to give you a better preview of their content. Whether you have photos, videos, documents, or any other type of file, you can enjoy browsing them with enhanced thumbnails.
