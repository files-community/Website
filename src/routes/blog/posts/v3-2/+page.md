## What's new in v3.2

### Browse large folders with confidence

We know how frustrating it can be when Files crashes or freezes while browsing large folders. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve made significant improvements to enhance stability. Our team has worked hard to reduce crashes when browsing large folders and when adding and deleting items. We believe these improvements will make your experience smoother and more enjoyable.

### Display more items with List View

List View is a new layout option that lets you display more items while taking up less space. It only shows the icons and file names of your items, without any extra details. This is perfect for when you want to quickly scan through a large number of files or folders. To use List View, click on the layout icon on the toolbar and choose List View from the flyout menu.

### Customize your album covers

You can now change the album covers on media files directly from Files. This is a great way to personalize your music collection and make it easier to find your favorite albums. To do this, right-click on any media file and choose Properties. Click on the preview of the current cover and select a new image when prompted.

### Enhanced thumbnails for your files

Weâ€™ve enhanced the resolution and contrast of our thumbnail previews to make them more visually appealing and easy to identify. We also fixed a bug where thumbnails would sometimes fail to load in OneDrive.
