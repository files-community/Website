**TL;DR:** Files v3.3 has a refreshed layout picker, additional spacing options for the layouts, more reliable thumbnails, improvements to continue where you left off, and more. Continue reading to learn more about these changes.

## What's new in v3.3

### Redesigned layout picker

We refreshed the layout picker with a cleaner and more functional design. The layout options are now displayed in a single row with large buttons, and the selected layout is highlighted using the system accent color.

Beneath the the layout section, we added a slider to control the item sizes of the various views including Details, List, Grid, & Columns. Whether you prefer larger or smaller items, there is an option for your personal preference.

### Thumbnail performance and DPI support

In v3.3, we continued working on thumbnail handling. While there is always room for improvement, you can anticipate a more reliable experience with fewer overall issues related to thumbnails.

When a thumbnail takes longer to load, a shimmer animation will be displayed to indicate that the content is loading. Additionally, we added DPI support for icons on the home page, tabs, and left-hand sidebar.

### Added a settings page to manage layout preferences

We added a new settings page to simplify the management of your layout preferences. These options, formerly nested within submenus on the "Folders" settings page, are now more accessible and easier to locate. Additionally, the "Folders" page was renamed to "Files & folders".

### Continue where you left off when restarting Windows

Continue where you left off now works when Windows is restarted. Previously this feature only worked if you closed Files before restarting Windows.
