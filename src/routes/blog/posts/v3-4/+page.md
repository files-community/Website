## What's new in v3.4

### Personalize Files with a custom background image

We added a new theming feature that allows you to add a personal touch to Files by setting a custom background image. Simply go to Settings > Appearance, locate the "Background Image" section, and click "Browse" to choose your preferred image.

In addition to the Settings page, you can also change the background directly by right-clicking on an image and selecting "Set as app background".

Once selected, Files will update to display your image as a beautiful background, adding a distinctive touch to your workspace. Additionally, you can adjust the imageâ€™s opacity and display settings for a truly customized look.

### Remap keyboard shortcuts

We added a new settings page for Actions that enables you to personalize keyboard shortcuts. This feature lets you assign shortcuts to any action and offers the flexibility to modify existing key bindings. Customize your keyboard layout to enhance your workflow efficiency.

### Filter file names in real-time

Weâ€™ve enhanced our search functionality to allow for more efficient file management within the current directory. With the new filtering feature, inputting a query into the search bar instantly filters the directory, displaying only the files that match your criteria.

This real-time filtering saves time and is particularly beneficial for users who work with large numbers of files and require quick access to specific documents.

### Added an integration with Listary

We're excited to announce a new integration with [Listary](https://www.listary.com/) - a powerful search utility renowned for its rapid retrieval of files and folders. This integration can be enabled from the "Integrations" page within Listaryâ€™s settings. This integration includes the following features:

**Instant search results**: A double tap of the `ctrl` key brings up the search bar, delivering immediate access to your files.

**Contextual power**: Engage with Listaryâ€™s rich context menu by right-clicking any search result, unlocking a vast array of actions right where you need them.

**Quick switch**: Seamlessly transition to the active folder in Files when opening or saving documents via another application. Additionally, once the file dialog appears, you can also switch to Files, navigate to your desired folderâ€”such as a pinned locationâ€”and upon returning to the dialog, it will automatically update to reflect your chosen folder.

**Folder navigation**: Discover the ease of navigating to folders; a single click on any folder in the search results instantly opens it in the current tab or pane of Files.
