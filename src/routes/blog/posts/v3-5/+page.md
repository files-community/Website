We're excited to announce that starting today, Files v3.5 is now available. If you already have Files, there should be a notification on the toolbar to install the update. Otherwise, you can download Files for free from our [download page](/download/). You can also purchase Files on the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9nghp3dx8hdx&cid=FilesWebsite) or sponsor us on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/yaira2) to help support the project.

**TL;DR:** The latest update, Files v3.5, introduces a refreshed design, a new widget for network drives, improved multitasking with dual-pane enhancements, and better crash reports to help us improve stability, among others. Continue reading to learn more about these enhancements.

## What's new in v3.5

### Updated the design with rounded corners

Weâ€™ve enhanced Files aesthetics by applying rounded corners to additional UI surfaces, including the toolbar, content area, and preview pane. This refinement improves the overall consistency and visual flow throughout the app.

Additionally, Dual Pane mode now features a more pronounced shadow on the active pane and expanded spacing between panes. These enhancements ensure that the active pane is more visually prominent.

### View dimensions when hovering over images

When you hover over images, a tooltip will now conveniently show the dimensions. This enhancement greatly improves user experience by providing quick and easy access to size information.

### Open batch files in Notepad directly from the toolbar

Upon selecting a batch (.bat) file, the toolbar will now present an Edit in Notepad option, streamlining the process of modifying your batch files directly without the need to dig through context menus.

### Explore network locations on the Home Page

We added a "Network Locations" widget on the home page. This feature is designed to help you navigate and organize network locations with greater efficiency.

### Added support for closing the left pane in Dual Pane mode

Weâ€™ve added the ability to close the left pane in Dual Pane mode, overcoming previous technical limitations that only allowed closing the right pane. This improvements provides a more versatile and user-friendly experience.


### OneDrive sync status indicator

Experience enhanced clarity when you hover over a file in OneDrive locations. The sync icon will now display a tooltip detailing the fileâ€™s current sync status, offering a more direct and informative snapshot of your data synchronization.


### View duration for selected video files

When selecting multiple video files, the Details Pane will now display the total duration.


### New localizations added

Weâ€™ve expanded our language support to now include Belarusian.  Our localizations are largely maintained by our dedicated community members. If you'd like to get involved, we invite you to join us on Crowdin https://crowdin.com/project/files-app.


### Improvements to crash reporting and metrics 

While enhancements in performance and stability typically occur behind the scenes, we often get a lot of questions about our work in this area and we wanted to share some highlights.

- We've adopted Sentry for more robust crash reporting (shoutout to Sentry for their support of open-source projects), and we aim to extend its use to monitor performance metrics, ensuring Files gets faster with each update. 
- Our main challenge with startup speed has been the absence of Native AOT in WinAppSdk. Fortunately, Microsoft is working to address this, and we hope to integrate these advancements later in the year.
- We recently started a new effort to eliminate unnecessary dependencies and streamline app resources, effectively shrinking the appâ€™s footprint on your device.
