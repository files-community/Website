## What's new in v3.6

### Added an "Actions" menu to the title bar

We've added a new "Actions" menu in the title bar. This menu provides options to open a new window, toggle compact overlay, and manage panes in Dual Pane mode.

### Customize folder locations with unique background images 

We're excited to introduce support for customizing locations with unique background images. By assigning images to different paths, you can quickly identify and access your work, personal, and project directories. Additionally, you can adjust the image opacity and alignment to suit your preferences, ensuring a personalized expereince. You can learn how to get started with folder backgrounds on our [documentation page](/docs/features/folder-config).

### New localizations added

Weâ€™ve expanded our language support to now include Malay.  Our localizations are largely maintained by our dedicated community members. If you'd like to get involved, we invite you to join us on Crowdin https://crowdin.com/project/files-app.


### Optimized sorting performance when loading large folders 

Thanks to optimizations in the sorting code, large folders should now load faster. In our own tests, we observed a 167% increase in performance when loading 40,000 items. Please note that performance can vary based on factors such as device specifications and other running processes.
