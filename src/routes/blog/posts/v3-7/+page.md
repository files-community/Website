## What's new in v3.7

### Added a setting to hide the System Tray icon

You can now hide the System Tray icon through a new option in the Advanced settings page.


### Focus existing tab when opening locations from external process

When opening a location from an external process, Files will now switch to the existing tab if the location is already open, instead of creating a duplicate tab.


### View navigation history 

The back and forward toolbar buttons now display a history flyout when right-clicked. On a touchscreen, you can press and hold for a few seconds to display the menu.
