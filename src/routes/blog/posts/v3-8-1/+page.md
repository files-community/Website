### Taskbar

- Removed the number of open tabs from being displayed in the Windows Taskbar.

### Archives

- Added support for setting Files as the default app on Windows for opening `gz` archives.

### Drag & drop

- Improved the behavior so that Files is no longer brought to the foreground when dragging items to another application.

### Details Layout

- Modifying which columns are enabled in the Settings will now automatically update existing tabs. Previously, this setting only applied to tabs opened after the change.

### Release Notes

- The Release Notes dialog was updated to display changelogs directly from the Files website.
- Added a new [action](/docs/customize-settings/actions/) to open the Release Notes dialog. Previously, the dialog was only accessible during the session immediately following an update.

## Fixes

### Address Bar

- Fixed an issue where the address bar flyouts sometimes displayed duplicate items.

### Tabs

- Fixed an issue where tabs weren't placed in the correct order when dragged from other windows.

### Actions

- Fixed an issue with the 'Run with PowerShell' action not working for files with spaces in their names.

### Conclusion

As always, we appreciate your feedback and suggestions on how we improve Files. You can reach us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/files) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/files-community/Files/).

Thank you for using Files! ðŸ˜Š
