Today we are releasing **Files Preview v3.8.11** for users of the preview version. New users can get started from our [download page](/download/). Additionally, you can help support the project by purchasing Files on the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9NSQD9PKV3SS&cid=FilesWebsite) or sponsoring us on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/yaira2). Your support is greatly appreciated but entirely optional.

## Changes

### Performance

- Removed the open and close animations from the breadcrumb, back button, and forward button flyouts.
- Thumbnails in the above mentioned flyouts are now 'lazy' loaded.
- Items in the breadcrumb flyout now start loading as the flyout is opening, instead of after it has fully opened.

### Cloud drives

- Added support for Lucid Link v3.

### Tags

- Added back support for applying tags by dropping files onto tags in the sidebar.

## Fixes

### Drag & drop

- Resolved multiple issues with drag & drop support between Files and other applications.

### Right click context menu

- Fixed an issue where right clicking a file would display the option to open in a new tab.

### Columns View

- Fixed an issue which caused unexpected scrolling in the Columns Layout.

### Startup

- Fixed an issue where launching Files from Terminal didn't use the correct path.

### Address Bar

- Fixed keyboard navigation in the address path bar

## Conclusion

As always, we appreciate your feedback and suggestions on how we improve Files. You can reach us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/files) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/files-community/Files/).
