## Changes

### Introducing the Omnibar

We're excited to announce the new Omnibar control, a new design that merges the breadcrumb path and search box into a unified interface. The Omnibar isn't just a visual refresh. It introduces new functility while maintaining the precision and flexibility users expect.

**Breadcrumb bar:** The default Omnibar view shows the current path using a familiar breadcrumb layout. Breadcrumbs can be expanded to reveal subfolders via the chevron icon. We've also introduced a new home button and flyout menu, providing quick access to pinned and frequently used folders.

**Edit path:** Switching to edit path mode is done by clicking an empty space in the breadcrumb bar (as before), or by using the `Ctrl + L` keboard shortcut. When activated, the current path is automatically selected making it easy to copy, overwrite, or modify without extra clicks.

**Command Palette:** [Command Palette](/docs/features/command-palette/) mode is accessed by clicking the command button or by using the `Ctrl + Shift + P` keyboard shortcut. While the Command Palette was previously available via keyboard shortcuts, many users were unaware and therefore unable to take advantage. Now, this feature has a dedicated button in the UI making advanced commands easier to discover and use.

**Search:** Search mode is accessed by clicking the search icon or using the `Ctrl + F` keyboard shortcut. When opened, the search box is automatically focused so users can start typing immediately. Suggestions appear in a flyout, and pressing 'Enter' takes you to the dedicated search results page.

In earlier versions, typing a query in the search box without pressing 'Enter' would filter items in the current directory rather than performing a full indexed search. We found this behavior was causing confusion. To improve clarity, the filtering functionality has now been moved to a dedicated header (more on that below).

### Added a dedicated filter header

To reduce confusion between the search and filter functionality, we added a dedicated filter header within the file area. This header offers quick, lightweight filtering of the current directory without invoking the search index. It can be toggled on or off via the toolbar, and when enabled, the text box is automatically focused, making it easy to start typing without an extra click. Filtering is currently limited to file names only, providing fast and predictable results.

For even faster access, users can assign a custom keyboard shortcut from the [actions](/docs/customize-settings/actions) settings page. This makes it easy to integrate filtering into your workflow.

### Expanded cloud provider support  

Files now supports OX Drive integration, the full list of available providers can be viewed on our [cloud drive](/docs/features/cloud-drives) documentation.

## Fixes

### RTL

- RTL support has been added back to Files. Please note that some areas are still missing support (such as content dialogs).
