## Changes

### Signatures page in the properties window

A new **Signatures** page has been added to the properties window, making it easier to view digital signatures associated with a file.

### Improved Dual Pane experience

The Dual Pane feature has been refined to feel more intuitive:

- **Add pane** is now labeled **Split pane** for clarity  
- Added an [action](/docs/customize-settings/actions/) that lets you quickly toggle Dual Pane mode on or off
- Dual Pane settings now have a dedicated section in the [general](/docs/customize-settings/general) settings page
