Today we are releasing **Files Preview v3.9.15** for users of the preview version. New users can get started from our [download page](/download/).

## Changes

### Auto sized columns in Columns View

Columns now automatically adjust their width when opened, making navigation cleaner and more intuitive.

### Improved Dual Pane experience

When splitting a pane, the new pane now opens to match the path of the current pane.

### Browse all images formats in file picker

You can now browse all supported image formats when selecting a background image in Settings.

### Added actions to open log file and folder

We added two new actions to make it easier to access diagnostic logs:

- Open log file
- Open log folder

### Updated 7zip dependency

We've upgraded the 7zip library to version 25.01.

## Fixes

### Dual Pane

- Fixed an issue where the inactive pane would steal focus during file changes.
- Resolved a bug where switching layouts incorrectly focused the right pane.

### Toolbar

- Fixed issue where the 'layout' icon didn't match the select layout.

## Conclusion

As always, we appreciate your feedback and suggestions on how we improve Files. You can reach us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/files) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/files-community/Files/).
