Today we are releasing **Files Preview v3.9.2** for users of the preview version. New users can get started from our [download page](/download/). Additionally, you can help support the project by purchasing Files on the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9NSQD9PKV3SS&cid=FilesWebsite) or sponsoring us on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/yaira2). Your support is greatly appreciated but entirely optional.

## Changes

### Code Quality

- Replaced the Visual Studio .sln file with the new .slnx format.
- Updated to .NET 9
- Updated to WASDK 1.6
- Updated to CommunityToolkit.WinUI 8.2
- Updated to CsWinRT 2.2

### Added an option to change the default IDE

We've added a new option to change the default IDE. Previously, this feature was hardcoded to Visual Studio Code, but now you can set your preferred IDE from Developer Tolls in settings.
