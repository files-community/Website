Today we are releasing **Files Preview v3.9.4** for users of the preview version. New users can get started from our [download page](/download/). If you'd like to support the project, consider purchasing Files on the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9NSQD9PKV3SS&cid=FilesWebsite) or sponsoring us on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/yaira2). Your support is greatly appreciated but entirely optional.

## Changes

### Refreshed Release Notes experience

We've replaced the Release Notes dialog with a dedicated tab that opens automatically after updating Files. This makes it easier to explore what's new and improved in each release.

### Placeholder content for an empty sidebar

When all sidebar sections are hidden, placeholder content is now displayed to improve usability and provide helpful context.

### Settings context menu

Right-clicking the settings button now opens a context menu with an option to directly access the settings JSON file.

### Customizable size formats

You can now customize how file size units are displayed. This setting is available on the [Files & folders](/docs/customize-settings/files-and-folders/) settings page, giving you more control over how information is presented.

### Automatic encoding detection for ZIP files

We've added support for automatic encoding detection when extracting ZIP files. If needed, you can override the encoding manually from the extract archive dialog.

### UTF-8 encoding for ZIP creation

When creating ZIP archives, Files now uses UTF-8 encoding by default, ensuring better compatibility across different systems.
