Today we are releasing **Files Preview v4.0.1** for users of the preview version.

An update icon should be displayed in the top right corner of the app for existing users, while new users can get started from our [download](/download/) page. Additionally, you can help support the project by purchasing Files on the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9NSQD9PKV3SS&cid=FilesWebsite) or by sponsoring us on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/yaira2). Your support is greatly appreciated but entirely optional.

## What's new in Files v4.0.1

### Improved Startup Performance

Some users may notice a slight improvement in startup speed.

### GitLab Support

You can now clone GitLab repositories. Simply drag and drop the repository URL into Files, or use the `Clone a git repo` command from the Command Palette.

## Fixes

- Fixed an issue where clicking the file pane failed to close the Omnibar.
- Fixed an issue causing archives to open in a new tab rather than the current one.
- Fixed an issue where opening the Properties Window caused OneDrive files to download.

## Conclusion

As always, we appreciate your feedback and suggestions on how to improve Files. You can reach us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/files) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/files-community/Files/).

Thank you for using Files! ðŸ˜Š
