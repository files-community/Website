Today we are releasing **Files v4.0.10** for all users.

An update icon should be displayed in the top right corner of the app for existing users, while new users can get started from our [download](/download/) page. Additionally, you can help support the project by purchasing Files on the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9nghp3dx8hdx&cid=FilesWebsite) or by sponsoring us on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/yair100). Your support is greatly appreciated but entirely optional.

## What's New in Files v4.0.10

### Improved Startup Performance

Some users may notice a slight improvement in startup speed.

### GitLab Support

You can now clone GitLab repositories. Simply drag and drop the repository URL into Files, or use the `Clone a git repo` command from the Command Palette.


## Fixes

- Fixed an issue where clicking the file pane failed to close the Omnibar.
- Fixed an issue causing archives to open in a new tab rather than the current one.
- Fixed an issue where opening the Properties Window caused OneDrive files to download.
- Fixed an issue where opening git repos cloned with ssh would cause a command window to open.
- Fixed an issue where the delete tag button had poor styling.
- Fixed a crash that sometimes occurred when opening pinned items.


## Known Issues

We're currently investigating a regression in Files v4.0 where opening the context menu sometimes causes the app to crash.


## Conclusion

As always, we appreciate your feedback and suggestions on how to improve Files. You can reach us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/files) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/files-community/Files/).

Thank you for using Files! 😊
