Today we are releasing **Files Preview v4.0.14** for users of the preview version.

An update icon should be displayed in the top right corner of the app for existing users, while new users can get started from our [download](/download/) page. Additionally, you can help support the project by purchasing Files on the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9NSQD9PKV3SS&cid=FilesWebsite) or by sponsoring us on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/yaira2). Your support is greatly appreciated but entirely optional.

## What's New in Files v4.0.14

### Improvements to the Extract Archive dialog

- Users can now type the destination path directly in the Extract Archive dialog. Previously, the path could only be changed using the `Browse` button.
- The dialog now displays a list of recently used destination paths, enabling quick reuse without re-entering the same location.


## Fixes

- Prevent crash from occurring when invalid files are set as the lock screen wallpaper.
- Fixed an issue where the context menu was missing items in Columns View.


## Conclusion

As always, we appreciate your feedback and suggestions on how to improve Files. You can reach us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/files) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/files-community/Files/).

Thank you for using Files! ðŸ˜Š
