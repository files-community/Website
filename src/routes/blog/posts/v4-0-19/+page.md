Today we are releasing **Files Preview v4.0.19** for users of the preview version.

An update icon should be displayed in the top right corner of the app for existing users, while new users can get started from our [download](/download/) page. Additionally, you can help support the project by purchasing Files on the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9NSQD9PKV3SS&cid=FilesWebsite) or by sponsoring us on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/yair100). Your support is greatly appreciated but entirely optional.

## What's New in Files v4.0.19

### Settings

- Added independent "Open with single click" settings for files and folders. Previously, a single option controlled both together. You can now configure them separately to better match your workflow.

## Fixes

- Fixed an issue with opening shell locations like Recycle Bin on startup.
- Fixed an issue where changes to system environment variables didn't sync without restarting Files.
