Today we are releasing **Files Preview v4.0.22** for users of the preview version.

An update icon should be displayed in the top right corner of the app for existing users, while new users can get started from our [download](/download/) page. Additionally, you can help support the project by purchasing Files on the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9NSQD9PKV3SS&cid=FilesWebsite) or by sponsoring us on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/yaira2). Your support is greatly appreciated but entirely optional.

## What's New in Files v4.0.22

### PowerToys Peek

We're excited to be adding support for PowerToys Peek, a popular tool for previewing files on Windows. If you already have PowerToys installed, there's no need for additional setup. Just select an item in Files, and press the space key to see a preview. To learn more about PowerToys Peek, please see their documentation site https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/peek.
