Today we are releasing **Files Preview v4.0.23** for users of the preview version.

An update icon should be displayed in the top right corner of the app for existing users, while new users can get started from our [download](/download/) page. Additionally, you can help support the project by purchasing Files on the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9NSQD9PKV3SS&cid=FilesWebsite) or by sponsoring us on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/yair100). Your support is greatly appreciated but entirely optional.

## What's New in Files v4.0.23

### Faster File & Folder Creation

When creating a new file or folder, a default name is now prefilled and automatically selected. This allows you to quickly create files without having to manually enter a name, while making it easy to replace if you prefer to set one yourself.

### Omnibar

We added a shadow to the Omnibar suggestions flyout to better align with the WinUI styling.
