Today we are releasing **Files v4.0.24** for all users.

An update icon should be displayed in the top right corner of the app for existing users, while new users can get started from our [download](/download/) page. Additionally, you can help support the project by purchasing Files on the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9nghp3dx8hdx&cid=FilesWebsite) or by sponsoring us on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/yaira2). Your support is greatly appreciated but entirely optional.

## What's New in Files v4.0.24

### PowerToys Peek

We're excited to be adding support for PowerToys Peek, a popular tool for previewing files on Windows. If you already have PowerToys installed, there's no need for additional setup. Just select an item in Files, and press the space key to see a preview. To learn more about PowerToys Peek, please see their documentation site https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/peek.

We added copy functionality to the context menu when right clicking the sidebar and home page widgets.

### Faster File & Folder Creation

When creating a new file or folder, a default name is now prefilled and automatically selected. This allows you to quickly create files without having to manually enter a name, while making it easy to replace if you prefer to set one yourself.

### Omnibar

We added a shadow to the Omnibar suggestions flyout to better align with WinUI styling.
