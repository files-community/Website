Today we are releasing **Files Preview v4.0.25** for users of the preview version.

An update icon should be displayed in the top right corner of the app for existing users, while new users can get started from our [download](/download/) page. Additionally, you can help support the project by purchasing Files on the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9NSQD9PKV3SS&cid=FilesWebsite) or by sponsoring us on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/yaira2). Your support is greatly appreciated but entirely optional.

## What's New in Files v4.0.25

### Added option to disable smooth scrolling

Smooth scrolling can now be turned off from the General page in Settings.

### Updated right‑click context menu

The Properties option is now a primary action in both the sidebar and Home Page context menus, making it consistent with the other context menus in Files.

### Icon customization for URL and shortcut files

The customization page in Properties now supports changing icons for URL and shortcut file types.

### Support for the Microsoft Store version of Dropbox

We added cloud drive detection for the Store version of Dropbox. Previously, only the non-store version was detected.


## Fixes

- Fixed an issue with tag searches containing spaces.
- Fixed inconsistent file type display for hidden items.
- Fixed an issue where setting Files Stable as the default, then opening Files Preview, would incorrectly switch the default to the other version (and vice versa).
- Fixed an issue where SEER would reopen after manual closure.
- Fixed an issue where the Info Pane wasn't hidden on the Release Notes page.


## Conclusion

As always, we appreciate your feedback and suggestions on how to improve Files. You can reach us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/files) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/files-community/Files/).

Thank you for using Files! 😊
