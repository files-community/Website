Today we are releasing **Files Preview v4.0.26** for users of the preview version.

An update icon should be displayed in the top right corner of the app for existing users, while new users can get started from our [download](/download/) page. Additionally, you can help support the project by purchasing Files on the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9NSQD9PKV3SS&cid=FilesWebsite) or by sponsoring us on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/yair100). Your support is greatly appreciated but entirely optional.

## What's New in Files v4.0.26

### Context Menu Options

Added support for turning off the "Pin to Start" and "Pin to Sidebar" context menu items. These options are available under **Settings → General → Context Menu Options**.

### Thumbnail Caching

We're excited to begin testing a new system for caching thumbnails. This system is enabled by default for now, but it is still experimental and can be turned off from **Settings → Advanced → Experimental Feature Flags**.


## Fixes

- Fixed an issue where switching tabs via the scroll wheel didn't work correctly.


## Conclusion

As always, we appreciate your feedback and suggestions on how to improve Files. You can reach us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/files) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/files-community/Files/).

Thank you for using Files! 😊
