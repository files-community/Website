Today we are releasing **Files Preview v4.0.27** for users of the preview version.

An update icon should be displayed in the top right corner of the app for existing users, while new users can get started from our [download](/download/) page. Additionally, you can help support the project by purchasing Files on the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9NSQD9PKV3SS&cid=FilesWebsite) or by sponsoring us on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/yair100). Your support is greatly appreciated but entirely optional.

## What's New in Files v4.0.27

### Paused Thumbnail Caching Experiment

The experimental thumbnail caching setting has been removed from this build. We're looking forward to adding this back after further refinement.


## Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the 'Open With' menu was missing for script files.


## Conclusion

As always, we appreciate your feedback and suggestions on how to improve Files. You can reach us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/files) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/files-community/Files/).
