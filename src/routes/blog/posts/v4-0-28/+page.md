Today we are releasing **Files v4.0.28** for all users.

An update icon should be displayed in the top right corner of the app for existing users, while new users can get started from our [download](/download/) page. Additionally, you can help support the project by purchasing Files on the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9nghp3dx8hdx&cid=FilesWebsite) or by sponsoring us on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/yair100). Your support is greatly appreciated but entirely optional.

## What's Coming Soon

We're excited to share that we're actively working on performance improvements to make thumbnails load faster. These changes aren't included in today's stable release, but we hope to begin testing them in the Preview channel in the near future. We'll share more updates as progress and testing continues.


## What's New in Files v4.0.28

### Updated Right-Click Context Menu

The Properties option is now a primary action in both the Sidebar and Home Page context menus, improving consistency across Files.

### Context Menu Options

You can now disable the "Pin to Start" and "Pin to Sidebar" context menu items under **Settings → General → Context Menu Options**.

### Support for the Microsoft Store Version of Dropbox

### Icon Customization for URL and Shortcut Files

The Properties customization page now supports changing icons for URL and shortcut file types.

### Added Option to Disable Smooth Scrolling

Smooth scrolling can now be disabled from **Settings → General → Scrolling**.
