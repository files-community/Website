Today we are releasing **Files Preview v4.0.4** for users of the preview version.

An update icon should be displayed in the top right corner of the app for existing users, while new users can get started from our [download](/download/) page. Additionally, you can help support the project by purchasing Files on the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9NSQD9PKV3SS&cid=FilesWebsite) or by sponsoring us on [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/yair100). Your support is greatly appreciated but entirely optional.

## What's new in Files v4.0.4

- Fixed an issue where opening git repos cloned with ssh would cause a command window to open.
- Users may notice a slight decrease in resource consumption while starting Files.

## Conclusion

As always, we appreciate your feedback and suggestions on how to improve Files. You can reach us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/files) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/files-community/Files/).
