Files is a modern file manager that helps users organize their files and folders. Built and maintained by the open-source community, Files features robust multitasking experiences, file tags, deep integrations, and an intuitive design.

Our mission is to create the best file manager for Windows together with the open-source community. Built with the WinAppSdk framework, we're able to take advantage of the latest features and UI libraries from Microsoft.
