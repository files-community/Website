title: Set Files as the default file manager 
---

Windows doesn't have an official method for changing the default file manager. In order to work around this limitation, we developed a workaround that works for most scenarios including the `win` + `e` shortcut.

*This workaround involves modifying the system registry and while it's been tested and improved over time, the Files team takes no responsibility if something goes wrong. If you decide to proceed, we recommend creating a backup of the system registry beforehand.*

## Set Files as the default file manager 

1. Open the settings dialog in Files
2. Navigate to the experimental page
3. Toggle the switch for making Files the default File Manager

## Known limitations
- This method doesn't replace the system file pickers
