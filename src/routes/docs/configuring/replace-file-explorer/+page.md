title: Set Files as the default file manager 
---

 Unlike other applications, Windows doesn't include a built in method for changing the default file manager. In order to work around this limitation, we developed a workaround that redirects File Explorer to open Files instead.

*This workaround modifies the system registry in the background, the Files team takes no responsibility if something goes wrong. If you decide to continue, we recommend creating a backup of the system registry beforehand.*

## Set Files as the default file manager 

1. Open the settings dialog in Files
2. Navigate to the experimental page and toggle the switch to set Files as the default file manager

## Known limitations
- This option does not replace the system file pickers
