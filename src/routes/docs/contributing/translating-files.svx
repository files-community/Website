# Translating Files

### Adding a new language (requires Visual Studio 2019 and Multilingual App Toolkit)

- Ensure you have Visual Studio 2019 and
  the [Multilingual App Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MultilingualAppToolkit.MultilingualAppToolkit-18308)
  .
- Fork and clone the Files [repository](https://github.com/files-community/files/).
- Open in VS 2019.
- Right-click on the `Files (Universal Windows)` project.
- Select Multilingual App Toolkit > Add translation language.
    - If you get a message saying "Translation Provider Manager Issue," just click OK and ignore it. It's unrelated to
      adding a language.
- Select a language.
- Once you select a language, new `.xlf` files will be created in the `MultilingualResources` folder.
- Now follow the `Improving an existing language` steps below.

### Improving an existing language (can be done with any text editor)

- Inside the `\src\Files\MultilingualResources` folder, open the `.xlf` of the language you want to translate.
    - You can open using any text editor, or you can use
      the [Multilingual Editor](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/develop/multilingual-app-toolkit)
- If you're using a text editor, translate the strings inside the `<target>` node. Then change the `state` property
  to `translated`.

- If you're using the Multilingual Editor, translate the strings inside the `Translation` text field. Make sure to save
  to preserve your changes.

- Once you're done, commit your changes, push to GitHub, and make a pull request.
