## Sync layout and sorting preferences across directories

Located on the folders settings page, enabling this option will sync the layout and other folder settings across all directories.  For example, changing the layout in one folder will automatically change the layout for all other folders.

## Details View columns

Support for additional columns is being planned but in the meantime you can toggle the defaults for the following columns:
- Tags
- Size
- Type
- Date modified

To be able to override these options in an individual folder, make sure the option to sync preferences is toggled off.
