title: Dual pane
---

Dual pane is a powerful feature that allows users to view two different locations within the same tab. This feature is ideal for comparing folder contents, transferring items between directories, or efficiently working across two folders without the need to create additional tabs or windows.

## Creating a new pane

The easiest way to add a second pane is by clicking the 'Actions' button in the top-left corner of the app. From there, users can also choose how the second pane is arranged. If two panes are already open, the menu will instead offer options to adjust their arrangement. In addition to this menu, you can add or remove panes using keyboard shortcuts or the [Command Palette](/docs/features/command-palette/). By default, new panes will open to the home page.

## Opening a folder in a new pane

 With the dual pane feature, you can right click any folder to open it in a new pane. This option is displayed in the context menu by default, but you can disable it from the 'General' settings page if needed.

## Open new tabs with dual pane

Though disabled by default, there is an option to open new tabs in dual pane mode. This option can be enabled from the 'General' settings page.
