## Create a horizontal or vertical pane

Files supports arranging panes horizontally or vertically in the dual pane layout to make organizing files and folders as comfortable as possible.
This feature was first introduced in [Files v3.6](/blog/posts/v3-6).

You can open a new horizontal or vertical pane using the tab actions menu in the top left corner of the title bar.

## Rearrange open panes

You can also rearrange currently open panes if the app is in dual pane mode.
This can be activated via the [command palette](/docs/features/command-palette).
