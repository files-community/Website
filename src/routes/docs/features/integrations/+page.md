## QuickLook

QuickLook is a popular tool for previewing files on Windows. If you already have QuickLook installed, there’s no need for additional setup. Just select an item in Files, and press the space key to see a preview. You can also use the arrow keys to navigate through the previews of different items. To learn more about QuickLook, please see their GitHub repo https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook.


## SeerPro

SeerPro is a robust tool for previewing files on Windows, offering a similar experience to QuickLook with a key enhancement. Once SeerPro is installed, you can immediately preview items by selecting them in Files and pressing the space key. A standout feature of SeerPro is its ability to copy images or video frames directly to the clipboard.

**Quick switch**: Seamlessly transition to the active folder in Files when opening or saving documents via another application. Additionally, once the file dialog appears, you can also switch to Files, navigate to your desired folder—such as a pinned location—and upon returning to the dialog, it will automatically update to reflect your chosen folder.
