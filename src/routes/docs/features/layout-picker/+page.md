title: Layout picker
---

The layout picker is where you can change the layout type and size for the current directory. For more information about configuring the default layout, please see the documentation on [layout](/docs/customize-settings/layout/) settings.

## Options

### Layout type

Unless the setting to sync layouts preferences is enabled, changing the layout from the layout picker will only apply to the current directory. The available layout types are:

- Details
- List
- Tiles
- Grid
- Columns

### Size

First introduced in v3.3, you can adjust the items to be bigger or smaller by using the size slider. This option isn't available for Tiles, but we're exploring different ideas and hope to add this option in the future.

### Show hidden items

This toggles hidden items on & off, it's worth noting that changing this toggle will also affect the option in the settings dialog.

### Show file extensions

This toggles file extensions on & off. Like the option for hidden files, this toggle will also affect the option in the settings dialog.

### Adaptive layout

Enabling this option will automatically select the best layout for the folder contents. It's important to note that this option is only available when syncing layouts preferences is off.
