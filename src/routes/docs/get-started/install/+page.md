## Install and get started with Files

<Button href="/download/" variant="accent">
	Install Files
</Button>

Files is a community-driven project that depends on your support to grow and improve. Please consider purchasing Files through the Microsoft Store or supporting us on GitHub if you use the classic installer.

You can also use the preview version alongside the stable release to get early access to new features and improvements.

<InfoBar title="Note" severity="information">
	The Windows Update and Delivery Optimization services will need to be enabled in order for the installation to work. Modified versions of Windows or running "debloat" scripts/programs are often missing these components and aren't supported.
